       <p>As of the date of this writing, it has been nearly 3 decades since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Since then some of the modern countries that once made up the Soviet Union have had various struggles with with Alcoholism and increased suicide rates. However, it is fascinating to see how religious belief affects the population attitudes towards alcohol use. In particular we see how in countries that have a stronger religious belief that alcohol consumption is drastically lower. We also see that in former Soviet Republics where the predominate religion is Islam that alcoholism is almost non-existent. This is probably due to strict moral laws in Islam that forbid alcohol consumption. These moral laws are not present in Christianity and more importantly, the more secular the culture is of each country, the higher the rate of alcoholism.</p>
